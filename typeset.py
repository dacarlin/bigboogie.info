# Idea: have a Python script typeset the blog 
#
# python typeset.py index.md index.html 
#
# generates index.html from index.md, which is just the blog 
# in Markdown
#
# example blog post 
#
# ```
# # Song in key of A
#
# The text and stuff here 
# 
# <canvas alt="123456 E"></canvas>
#
# I believe will just work with Markdown. Anyway that's the idea
